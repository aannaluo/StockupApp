# Food Stock and Waste Management Application

---

## Application Description

The goal of this project is to:
- **track food** items you currently have in stock at home
- amount of **food waste** generated
- what categories of food get wasted most

Users who want to be more **environmentally conscious** of their food waste will
want to use this app to be aware of their consumption habits. Users who also want to 
**keep track of their food items** currently at home to know what can be used for their 
next meal and what to buy will also want to use this application. When users know what 
is most commonly being wasted they may be more mindful of how much they buy next time.

Food waste is a growing concern towards its **impact to the environment**, and I wanted
to make something that could help individuals track their own **food waste**, which can
not only potentially **help the environment** but themselves **financially** as well. 
Personally, I have noticed that my household generates a lot of food waste while also 
having trouble in remembering what is already at home before going grocery shopping. 
I think that having access to this application could definitely help solve these problems.
